                <div class="aboutText">
                    <p>Hello! I'm <b>Riccardo Bean</b>, a Computer Science student at <b>NYU Tandon School of
                            Engineering</b>, pursuing my Bachelor's degree with minors in <b>Astronomy</b>,
                        <b>Mathematics</b>, and <b>Game Engineering</b>.</p>

                    <p>I was born and raised on the colorful island of <i>Burano</i>, a small yet vibrant part of
                        Venice, Italy. At sixteen, I moved to New York for what was supposed to be a single semester
                        abroad: a short adventure that unexpectedly became a turning point in my life.</p>

                    <p>Adapting to a new city, culture, and language was challenging at first, but it also taught me
                        resilience, curiosity, and independence. What started as a temporary stay evolved into a
                        long-term journey of growth, leading me to graduate high school in the U.S. and continue my
                        studies at NYU.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="aboutText1">
                <p>Today, my interests lie at the intersection of technology and creativity. I love exploring how
                    systems work, whether that's through <b>game design</b>, <b>software development</b>,
                    <b>cybersecurity</b>, or <b>astronomy</b>. I enjoy creating projects that blend logic, design, and
                    storytelling into meaningful digital experiences.</p>
